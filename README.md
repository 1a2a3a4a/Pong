This is a fan made game of the most epic game ever Pong.
This is a game for two players and is not fun to play alone.
Player one controls the left bar with the keys "w" for up  and "s" for down. 
Player two controls the rigt bar with the keys "i" for up and "k" for down.
The meaning of the game is to hit the ball with the bar and make it hard for the other player to hit the ball.First to ten goals wins.
If you are not som good at the game as the other player, you will get a handicap, depending on the score difference.
